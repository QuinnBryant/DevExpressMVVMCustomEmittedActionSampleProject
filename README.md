DevExpressMVVM Custom Emitted Action Sample Project
====================
This project is simply demonstrating a modification to the DevExpress.WPF/ViewModelSource.cs BuildBindableSetterProperty Emit logic. The PropertyGridSample project demonstrates a single instance where this change is needed. 
This repo is associated with this DevExpress ticket https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T825914/raising-property-changed-events-on-a-property-when-it-s-child-property-has-changed

I uploaded this project into github and not the ticket itself due to file size restrictions in the DevExpress Support forums.

DevExpress.Mvvm.Free
====================
DevExpress.MVVM.Free can be found here. https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExpress.Mvvm.Free
This is an open source project that the nice folks from DevExpress created.
